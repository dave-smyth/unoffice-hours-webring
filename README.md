# Unoffice Hours
A webring for people offering Unoffice Hours.

## How to submit your site

**Add the webring links to your site first**, then fork this repo, add your name and Unoffice Hours URL to the [sites.js](https://github.com/websmyth/unoffice-hours-webring/blob/main/sites.js) file, and send me a pull request. 

If you’re unfamiliar with Github, [send me an email](mailto:dave@websmyth.co.uk) and I’ll get you set up.

## How to add the webring to your site

You should display the links on your site somewhere: perhaps on your Unoffice Hours page. You can style the links however you want.

**All you need to do is add the following links to your site somewhere:**

| Link Description | URL |
|---|---|
| Previous site | `https://unofficehours.com/prev.html` |
| Next site | `https://unofficehours.com/next.html` |
| Random site | `https://unofficehours.com/random.html` |
| List all sites | `https://unofficehours.com` |
| Join the ring | `https://unofficehours.com/join.html` |

The link will work out your position in the list and redirect visitors to the next site in the webring.

## Links API

You can retrieve a list of the webring links (next/previous/random/list/join) as either an HTML unstyled-list partial or a JSON file from:

* [HTML](https://unofficehours.com/links.html)
* [JSON](https://unofficehours.com/links.json)

## Privacy

We don't collect or store any information beyond the list of sites themselves. This is for fun, not for profit.

## Credits

Matt Webb created [Unoffice Hours](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours) as a twist on office hours in September 2020.

This webring was launched in September 2021 to make it easier to find people offering Unoffice Hours.

Thanks to Jack McDade for [the webring code](https://github.com/jackmcdade/weird-wide-webring). 🙏
